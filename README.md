This code generates a list of 24 random integers between 0 and 50 to simulate hourly traffic volume data. It then calculates the average traffic volume for the day and determines the congestion level based on the following criteria:
Very Low: Average traffic volume is less than 10
Low: Average traffic volume is between 10 and 19
Moderate: Average traffic volume is between 20 and 29
High: Average traffic volume is between 30 and 39
Very High: Average traffic volume is 40 or greater
You can call the assess_traffic_congestion() function to get the congestion level for a given day. You could modify this code to incorporate additional data sources or adjust the congestion level criteria to better suit your specific needs.
